# **Team Report**

## Last Week Goals

Empty for the first week

## Progress and Issues

### What we did

- Requirement assignment
- Set up meetings outside of the required meetings
- Changed the design to include an auto-queue where the TA does initial setup for the class queue that will be used all quarter. Previously we thought that each queue would be set up manually.
- Initial commit for Gitlab repo
- Moved a few main features into the "stretch goals" category because of complexity

### What worked

- Working collaboratively where everyone is contributing thoughts & ideas
- Communicating frequently on Slack (so far)

### What we learned

- Working as a group requires coordination/organization to operate smoothly
- Trying to schedule 5 people to meet at the same time is challenging

### Where we had trouble

- Struggling with pinpointing the appropriate scope for the project
- Having difficulty creating a timeline with realistic goals and milestones

## Next Week Goals

- Finish architecture and design assignment by Sunday
- Add README to repo
- Add bookmark of repo in Slack
- Want to figure out what information NetID will give us access to
- Ask about Azure credits for connecting to NetID
