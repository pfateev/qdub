# **Team Report**

## Last Week Goals

- ~~Interview TA's~~
- ~~Get mock data tables set up in db~~
- Connect more front end pieces to backend functionality
- ~~Automate deployment~~

## Progress and Issues

### What we did

- Finished and deployed beta
- Came to agreement with what the final version will look like
- Conducted interviews with TA's

### What worked

- Group communication
- Dividing tasks up and completing them on time

### What we learned

- Frequent check-ins are necessary to keep everyone on the same page
- Turning a seemingly simple idea into reality is much more difficult than previous imagined
- There are a lot of moving parts to a full-stack project that need to be addressed

### Where we had trouble

- Had some issues getting Docker set up on everyone's devices
- Estimating the amount of time we have and how long each action item will take

## Next Week Goals

- Set up database with fake data
- Add notifications features for TAs
- Multiple server support on front and back end
- Clean up any old branches
- Basic input validation

# **Individual contributions**

## Wendi

### What I did

- Worked on creating Modal for the front-end
- Edited the flow of the application
- Recorded the demo portion for the reflection video
- Divided up tasks for frontend

### What worked

- Finalized the beta version and moving on to creating the final version

### What I learned

- The issues that we currently have with our application
- Features that actual TA would like to have

### Where I had trouble

- Issues with setting up and running docker on my laptop

## Izzy

### What I did

- Set up database with seed data for next steps in project process
- Added documentation for our technical process for bug tracking
- Recorded "project process" part of demo + reflection video
- Stitched/edit everyone's video parts together, uploaded to youtube & submitted beta release assignment

### What worked

- Working on split tasks asynchronously (for the demo + reflection video), this way we spent less time waiting on one another to complete their parts & avoided trying to synchronize everyone.

### What I learned

- Postgres has many different types to represent the same thing? For example the integer types all include: integer, smallint, bigint, int2, int4, and int8..
- Github has a very handy built-in "Issues" feature that I had never known about before this past week.

### Where I had trouble

- Deciding on the final database design that we should use.

## Tri

### What I did

- Set up CI using Github action for backend and frontend.
- Look into Github Issues for bug tracking.
- Help debugging for our Beta release version.
- Make slides and recordings for Beta release.
- Interview 2 TA to get their feedback on what features we should focus on next.

### What worked

- Github Actions and Github Issues are working great for our project.

### What we learned

- Github has much more useful features than I knew before.

### Where we had trouble

- I didn't have much trouble this week on the tasks.

## Jared

### What I did

- Created new updated functions for swap, status, enqueue, dequeue, and remove functions
- Created tests for these functions
- Interviewed 3 TA's and students

### What worked

- The interviews gave a lot of great insight

### What I learned

- I learned that the swap features were essential in our final product and having a direct message to the office hours was also a huge plus that many agreed with

### Where I had trouble

- I had trouble with the logic behind the step in and step out features.
- Many of the tests did not pass and the new enqueue broke some previous tests so we need to debug this portion

## Pasha

### What I did

- Wrote instructions for building the project
- Did TA interviews for feedback on our project and which features to add
- Created a flow chart that shows how data moves through the system
- Added code for the front-end and back-end to work as expected for Beta release
- Wrote out high level action items for the rest of the project

### What worked

- The team as always worked really well together, when we all understood what we were doing

### What I learned

- Trying to keep the big picture in mind is very challenging after you get into the minute details of a project
- During meetings it's important to assign work to people on the spot or else the action items are defined, but they sort of float about

### Where I had trouble

- Keeping track of what needs to be done
- Juggling this class with others is tough when you want to be able to achieve the best product possible
