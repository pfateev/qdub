# Q'ed Up
### What is Q'ed Up?
A priority queueing web application made by UW students in CSE 403 with the ambition to make office hours more systematic & straightforward.
#### Goals of this project:
- Have a working priority queue that supports necessary queue functionality
  - for example: enqueue, dequeue, change priority, etc.
- Support login authentication through UW NetID
- Differentiate between students and faculty in order to show the corresponding UI & give correct permissions
  - for example: UI for faculty will have functionality to see the queue, manually edit the queue & broadcast messages to everyone on the queue. Student UI will not be able to see the queue but see a time estimation.
